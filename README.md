## Project Overview

In this project, I analyze the menu items and order details from a restaurant database. The goal is to uncover insights that can help improve menu offerings, pricing strategies, and understand customer ordering behavior.

## Business Task

The primary business task is to evaluate the restaurant's menu and order patterns to optimize both the menu and customer satisfaction. Specifically, we aim to:

1. **Analyze Menu Pricing:** Determine the range of prices for menu items, identify the most and least expensive items, and analyze pricing trends within different categories.

2. **Assess Menu Composition:** Evaluate the distribution of dishes across various categories, including popular cuisines like Italian, and assess the diversity of the menu.

3. **Order Analysis:** Investigate order trends, such as the number of items per order, the most frequently ordered items, and identify high-spending orders.

4. **Customer Preferences:** Understand customer preferences by examining the popularity of different menu items and categories, especially among top-spending orders.

The insights gained from this analysis will help the restaurant in refining its menu, setting optimal prices, and enhancing customer satisfaction by better understanding their preferences.
